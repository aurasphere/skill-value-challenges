# SkillValue Challenges
My solutions to challenges on https://www.skillvalue.com.

Each score is computed based equally on this four parameters of the code:

 - the time needed to compile (**SPEED**)
 - the number of compilations (**KNOW-HOW**)
 - the proportion between failed/passed (**ACCURACY**)
 - the cyclomatic complexity of your code, etc (**EFFICIENCY**)
 
 I may have tried some of this challenges more than once to maximize these parameters and improve my code quality.
