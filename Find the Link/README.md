## Problem
Given a set of strings, **find the longest common substring**. It is assumed that the input set of strings will **never** have more than one substring in common.

### Input
File containing a vector of strings on each line.
### Output
A string representing the common string. If the strings have no common substring, the output should be 0.

### Example:

For:
orchestra
check
chelsea

The output is **che** (common sub-sequences are not considered valid outputs; that is, **ch** and **he** in the given example, are not considered valid outputs).

For:
comparablestar
complementary
ri

The output is **r**.
